They are about to launch a new survey and want \"to anticipate, based on previous survey results, places where we might expect issues or challenges when we launch the new survey\". Specific items like: response counts, skip rates, and response frequency distribution for each question should be included along with any other metrics you can think of that will help the researchers identify questions that are potentially problematic (e.g, low response rates, no variability). If they identify questions (or wording of questions) that don't provide much information they will be able to update/modify the questions on the new survey to help get better information.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00001-65b2d2ba-21b5-4a12-8e1a-54a8fc02f193","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Tasks:\n<pre> <p style = \"font-family:helvetica;font-size:80%\">\n1) Use the attached codebook to generate synthetic response data.

I would expect the actual data will be a csv file with one row per respondent and one column per question plus columns for user id and demographic information.\n \n2) Create a Jupyter Notebook that performs the operational analysis for each question.\n              a) Make it clear what type of input data is expected so our research partners can easily use their actual data in place of your synthetic data.\n              b) There should be an analysis for each question, and possibly for each question group (if it makes sense).\n              c) Provide a way for our partners to stratify these metrics across various demographic categories, for instance skip rates by racial identity.\n \n3) Notes that briefly describe the parts of the notebook that need improving if you were given more time.</p>\n</pre>","metadata":{"cell_id":"00002-714a22c6-ffdf-41b1-a8a9-49c5afc8c301","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Codebook Data","metadata":{"cell_id":"00003-a7430be3-301e-4b6d-90ac-ef231435d600","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00004-3c07e20f-7e2f-4d53-976c-e39523dd960c","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"9b82ee11","execution_millis":3,"execution_start":1604528586261},"source":"import pandas as pd","execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00005-fd25af12-b627-45b7-90cf-e9228f9abed7","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"22fe5f9","execution_millis":221,"execution_start":1604528586267},"source":"try:\n    data = pd.read_excel(\"All of Us _ Public PPI Codebook - COPE.xlsx\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install xlrd\n    data = pd.read_excel(\"All of Us _ Public PPI Codebook - COPE.xlsx\")\n","execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Notes:\n* There exist 365 items in the dataframe.
